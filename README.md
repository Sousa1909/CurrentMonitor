# CurrentMonitor
MSc Project that consists in a Current Monitor using a Raspberry Pi Pico W.  
The objective of this project is to use concepts from MQTT (Publisher, Broker & Subscriber). The `Publisher`, our `Raspberry Pi Pico W`, publishes the values read by an AC Current Sensor to a `Broker` hosted in a VM. That very same VM will also host a webserver to which anyone can access to `Subscribe` to the content.

## What material do I need?
* To replicate this project you will need:  
  1. A Raspberry Pi Pico W -> [Information](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/microcontrollers/raspberry-pi-pico.html)
  2. An Analog Current Sensor -> [Like this one](https://www.dfrobot.com/product-1486.html)
  3. A Breadboard
  4. Some connector cables
  5. A source of AC current

## Is there anything I need to know?
* It is important to know some aspects about our `Raspberry Pi Pico W`

* Relevant information for the context of the project:
  * Pins:
    * 39 - VSYS -> This is the input voltage, which can range from 2 to 5-volts, which is the Vcc pin we need/have to use since we need 5V to power the sensor.
    * 38 - GND -> A ground pin like any other, I just picked this one because it is close to the Vcc one (Yeah that's the reason ðŸ˜Ž)
    * 31 - ADC0 -> We need a Analog pin for the data gathered by the sensor, which means we have 3 options (Pins: 31, 32 and 34).
  * Vagrant:
    * The VM we are going to be using is launched via [Vagrant](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vagrant).
      * This means:
          1. You need to [install Vagrant](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vagrant/downloads), if you don't have it already
          2. After installing all you have to do is:
        > Run `vagrant up` in any terminal. This will create the VM according to the specifications in the `Vagrantfile` and the Shell scripts under `/scripts`.  
        > When that is done if you want to access the VM's terminal all you have to do is `vagrant ssh`

        > **Warning**  
        > When running `vagrant up` make sure you are under the same directory as the `Vagrantfile` or else it won't work.

## How do I put together all the physical components?
* Here is the connection diagram:

> **Note**  
> You can only use the AC current sensor to clamp one of the terminals (positive or negative, it it the same) of your AC source, since they cancel each other out and if you were to clamp both you would be reading a null (as in 0) value.
